# melanie

monty asked proxy if he wanted to buy EVERYTHING related to melanie (api, bot, website) because monty was in a tough spot financially. proxy agreed to pay $1,500. everything was fine until monty wanted to ban known extorters, proxy disagreed, and they argued. in the end, monty deleted the bot app, stole the vanity, and proxy posted the source code publicly
